# FinalYearProject

This repo contains the final version of the Java Android Application I created for my dissertation.

It's a simple complete the sentence type game developed based on the idea of Parson's Problems. The object is to drag blocks of code into the correct place to complete the algorithm. Feedback is given to the user if they submit a wrong answer. This was also my first attempt at creating a mobile application.
